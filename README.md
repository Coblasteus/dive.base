DIVE.BASE is a stripped down version of [DIVE.CONTINUEED](https://github.com/Coblasteus/dive.continued) (which is based on Universal Dive). This is a great modding base if you ever wanted to make mods for Universal Dive. The only things I have included are the title screen, the credits, a test level, and a button to erase your data.
